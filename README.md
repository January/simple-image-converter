Simple Image Converter
================
A simple, no frills command-line script that allows you to convert images between most modern formats (e.g. `png`, `jp(e)g`, `jfif`, `gif`, `webp` etc.) *en masse*. You can just feed the filenames in as args, and then the format, and then this script will convert all the provided files to the specified format.

I originally made this to deal with an incredibly annoying amount of webps that needed to be converted to pngs, and I couldn't find a very quick way of doing them all together. So I made a way myself.

Usage
======
`python3 simple_convert.py image1 [image2, image3...] format`
